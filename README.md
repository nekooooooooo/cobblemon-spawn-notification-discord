## Currently Supported Discord Integration Mods

- [Discord Integration](https://modrinth.com/plugin/dcintegration) by ErdbeerbaerLP
- [MC2Discord](https://modrinth.com/mod/mc2discord) by DenisD3D

## How to Enable

**Currently only works when ``announceCrossDimensions`` is set to true inside ``spawn_notification.json`` as I thought that would make the most sense. I will update it in the future to include a config file instead**

Open ``spawn_notification.json`` inside ``config/``

Set ``"announceCrossDimensions"`` to ``true``
